The Indian education system is so exam-oriented that it strips away the students' ability to think. Frustrated with the system, Ruchi Manglunia and I started IndiaAsksWhy in 2021. We wanted to show high schoolers that science is about chasing curiosity. Cut to the present, we have now finished season 1 and are running season 2. You can listen to episodes and explore the podcast at [indiaaskswhy.org](https://www.indiaaskswhy.org/).

Due to the pandemic, we stuck to creating digital content. A few months ago, I was asked if the podcast was what the public really wanted. A month ago, Siddharth Kankaria and Ipsa Jain (during a [SciComm Unplugged feedback session](https://twitter.com/shweataHegde/status/1541625287888076800)) also posed the same question: Do you know what your audience wants? I did not have an answer. That's when I realized that we had _assumed_ that the content in the podcast was what the audience wanted. Since then, I have really wanted to talk about IndiaAsksWhy to high school students in person to understand them and the school environment.

## How the session went
Back story. I had to visit schools as a part of my coursework. That's how I met Pramati Hillview Academy school's principal. I had a wonderful conversation with him -- our discussion can be a different blog post altogether. I told him about IndiaAsksWhy and gently asked if I could talk about it in one of the classes. He readily agreed. My class was scheduled at 1315, the first class after lunch. I had 2 hours in hand and spent all that time sitting in the library and preparing slides. 

I started off with a brief intro about myself and asked how many liked asking curious questions. I gave them example questions to start with and prompted students to ask more. Students were initially hesitant, but when one of them started, others followed. We had about 30 questions by the end of the activity (list of questions in slides 6 and 7).

After the activity, I spent the rest of my time discussing why rain smells good sometimes question ([Season 1, Episode 5](https://www.indiaaskswhy.org/episode/2022-03-24-why-does-rain-smell-good/)). We had a short Q&A later where students asked: "Does _streptomyces_ produce geosmin only to attract springtails? What happens when springtails go extinct? Why should springtails disperse? How long does it take for raindrops to reach the ground?".

In the class of 20, most were active, but the last benchers didn't seem too involved. They didn't ask questions and were never involved in discussions. I had the attention of at least 70 % of the class. Not bad for my first-ever class.

## Learnings
### Strategy
I had to explain a concept at least three times for the students to get them. Putting out the episodes is only half the job done. Having live discussions with school students makes it complete. I also think we should catch hold of similar schools/organizations that would let us talk with high school students, even if it's on a quick video call.

### Content
The visuals helped. I could use the infographics we are developing next time around. The students enjoyed videos of springtails and aerosol generation. The slides also ensured that I stuck to the outline I had set for myself. 

## What could have been different
- I could have, 
  - like Ruchi later pointed out, asked students to write down their questions and names on a piece of paper. We generated questions, but I don't know who asked them. I asked students to submit questions through our website, haven't gotten any so far.
  - asked for feedback from the teacher who sat through the class and from students.
  - played a snippet of the episode during the class and showed students how to listen since they weren't familiar with the podcast as a content format.
  - taken more pictures! I have very little documentation.

- When students came up with interesting questions, I appreciated them and jotted down the questions. Maybe I could have given one-line thoughts on some of these questions. I don't know if they were looking for immediate answers to these questions. I also didn't know what to say to questions like: "Why is education important?"

- I should also think of a survey where we systematically analyze students' views on science.

Overall, it was a great first experience. I would love to improve upon the format and do more of these!
