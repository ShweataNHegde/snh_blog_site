“Why is sky blue?”, “Why do trees never stop growing? ” “Why are babies cute?” etc. – questions like these are powerful to create curiosity and inquisitiveness in learners. The saying “Curiosity is the fuel for discovery, inquiry, and learning” highlights the importance of exploration. 
To encourage such a questioning attitude, a science podcast, “IndiaAsksWhy”, was started by young enthusiastic communicators: Shweata N. Hegde, Ruchi Manglunia, and Dr. Megha Kumar. In this podcast series, the two characters, Utsuka and Jigyasa, ask and answer curious questions. Scientists from varied disciplines join to help them understand the answers. IndiaAsksWhy is one of the awardees of the IndiaBioscience Extension Grant. 

It was a privilege for the 8th graders of Pramati Hillview Academy, Mysore, to interact with the scientists from the IndiaAsksWhy Team. The program was organized on 25th Feb. 2023  as a part of the National Science Day celebration. A lot of inquisitive minds posed quite a number of curious questions. Many of us asked questions that seemed to have no explanations. We also posed written questions in the “Question Box.” Dr. Divya Kumar, the scientist of the day, briefed us about fatty liver and the methodologies used to study the effects of junk food on the liver. The session was enjoyable, interactive, and interesting. 

We were happy to participate in this session. We thank our school and IndiaAsksWhy team for providing this opportunity. Whenever a question arises, IndiaAsksWhy can help you. Questions can be posted at their web portal, www.indiaaskswhy.org, and emailed to indiaaskswhy@gmail.com anytime, anywhere.
