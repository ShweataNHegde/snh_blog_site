You may have heard the proverb ‘birds of a feather flock together’. Did you know that this age old proverb actually originated from the observations of scientists and philosophers? Over the years, scientists have found that flying in groups has several benefits that help birds survive longer. In this [episode](https://www.indiaaskswhy.org/episode/2022-01-20-why-do-birds-fly-in-groups/) of IndiaAsksWhy, Utsuka and Jigyasa glide into the world of birds to explore how they benefit from flying in groups.

Fascinated by the grouping behaviour of some bird species, Utsuka and Jigyasa talk with Dr. Vishwesha Guttal, a theoretical ecologist studying animal behaviour at the Indian Institute of Science, Bangalore. Dr. Guttal explains that the grouping behaviour of birds is driven by the benefits and costs of grouping, which are in turn affected by multiple qualitative and quantitative factors, including the life stage of the bird. His lab integrates the principles of physics, mathematics, ecology and evolutionary biology to study grouping behaviour in birds and animals. Wondering how they do this? They measure quantities such as bird size and group size, in the field, and use this data to study the dynamics of and find patterns in grouping behaviour. They then describe these patterns and dynamics through mathematical equations and computational models. Did you know that scientists can use these models and equations to predict future dynamics and behavioural changes? Dr. Guttal’s lab uses them to predict the effects of human interactions and environmental changes on the grouping behaviour of birds and animals.

Did we tell you that Dr. Guttal is a physicist-turned-ecologist? Curious to know how he ventured into theoretical ecology after his training in physics? Like many of us, Dr. Guttal is mesmerized by the beauty and elegance of nature. He is much more fascinated by the biology of the macroscopic world that can be seen with the naked eye, rather than that of the microscopic world of cells. He is particularly fascinated by the fact that many natural biological phenomena can be explained through principles of mathematics and physics. Inspired by one of his professors who used the principles of physics and mathematics to study vehicular traffic, Dr. Guttal began his journey in theoretical ecology by studying ‘traffic flow’ in ant trails.

While Dr. Guttal enjoys answering curiosity-driven questions about nature, his job as a scientist involves many more roles that he loves, especially, thinking about science, teaching young students, and interacting and collaborating with people for his research. On the other side of the coin are monotonous administrative tasks that, although boring and often annoying, are essential to keep his lab up and running.

Dr. Guttal encourages science enthusiasts to develop a scientific temper, that is, to think about how science works, to question established facts and think about the scientific discoveries that shaped them. He urges budding scientists to chase their dream of a career in science without any hesitation! Listen to the [podcast](https://www.indiaaskswhy.org/episode/2022-01-20-why-do-birds-fly-in-groups/) to join Utsuka and Jigyasa as they chat with Dr. Vishwesha Guttal about his exciting work on the flocking of birds!

So, keep thinking, stay curious, and leave your questions on our website! :)
