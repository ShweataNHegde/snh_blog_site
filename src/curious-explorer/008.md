If you have a younger sibling you might have experienced this moment. Remember when your baby sister or brother was in your mother’s womb? How did you two used to talk? 

You’d speak to your mother’s belly and expect to feel a movement to confirm that your sibling can hear you. But what if you want to hear your baby sibling speak? Could the babies speak or cry while inside the womb? If they could, would you be able to hear when they do so? 

As known from research, a baby shows four types of behavior in the womb. They are either quietly sleeping, active-awake, quiet-awake or sportingly active (when they kick and move around). They do not cry inside the womb because they probably don’t need to communicate yet. 

Even if the babies could cry, we won’t be able to hear their cries coming from inside. The first cry of a baby is heard right after birth, when they come out of the womb, into the real world. 
I always used to wonder why babies cry all the time? Are they hurt or in pain every time they start crying? 

Well, the babies do not cry because they are hurt or in pain. Crying actually is the method of communication these little creatures have. They cry when in distress and need milk, water, or a change of diaper!
