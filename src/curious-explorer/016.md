Have you noticed the “ZZZZzzzzzzzzzz” pop-up in a call-out in cartoons and comics when the character is sleeping? At times, the ZZZzzzzz is accompanied by a harsh sound coming from the character’s throat. That hoarse sound is called a snore. 

Snoring is the sound of obstructed breathing usually caused by the vibration of tissues in the throat and nasal passages during sleep.  When you sleep, the muscles in your throat lose tone and relax. Since your lungs stay the same size, you have to get the same volume of air through a smaller space. When air flows past your relaxed throat, the tissues in the upper airway vibrate, resulting in the harsh, raspy noise. 

Snoring can simply be caused by the anatomy of your mouth, throat, and sinuses. Big tonsils or a large tongue can make it hard for air to flow through your nose and mouth. A deviated septum (when the cartilage that separates your nostrils is off-center) can also block the flow of air.

Several other factors can also cause the airway blockage leading to a snoring condition including: 
- Age: Snoring is more common as we age because muscle tone decreases, causing our airways to constrict (shrink)
- Overweight: Snoring is often reported in individuals with high BMI index (>25). It could be due to the fat deposition around the neck leading to constriction of the nasal passage. 
- Alcohol consumption: beverages containing alcohol and certain medications relax your muscles, restricting airflow through your nose, mouth and throat.

Almost every person snores occasionally, but in certain cases it could also be a symptom for an underlying health condition or a chronic disease. 
Doctors say “Snoring—especially loud snoring broken up by pauses in breathing and loud snorts or gasps as the sleeper takes a breath again—can be a sign of obstructive sleep apnea. Sleep apnea is a serious risk factor for cardiovascular disease. It should be found and treated as early as possible.”

If you have a minute and a balloon, consider doing this quick activity. Grab a balloon and inflate it. Now hold the neck of the balloon between your thumb and fingers to prevent deflating. Slightly release the pressure. As the air starts flowing out, you’ll hear a sharp sound. Let the balloon deflate completely.
Take a moment and inflate the balloon once again. This time, release the balloon allowing the air to move out at once, without any resistance. You won’t hear the same sharp sound.
