Have you ever looked up at the sky and wondered why some birds fly in groups? Join Utsuka and Jigyasa to find the reasons why. 

In the Ask A Scientist segment, they both talk to Dr. Vishwesha Guttal (https://teelabiisc.wordpress.com/), a theoretical ecologist, to know why some animals group whereas others donâ€™t. He also talks about how researchers use maths and computers to study grouping and other behaviours.
