“Why do trees not stop growing?”, Jigyasa asks!

Jigyasa and Utsuka were going through Utsuka’s photo album when they realized something: Utsuka had barely grown a foot taller in a few years, whereas the tree in their backyard had grown several feet. This made them wonder why trees continue to grow in height, unlike us. 

What is growth? What drives trees to grow? Do trees grow all the time? Listen to the episode to learn about the tale of how trees grow. 

Towards the end, they reach an interesting question: what happens if all trees grow to the same height? To explore that question, they talk with [Dr. Vinita Gowda](https://bio.iiserb.ac.in/faculty_profile.php?id=MTQ=&lname=Z293ZGF2), a plant scientist from the Indian Institutes of Science Education and Research (IISER), Bhopal. After answering their curious question about trees, she shares with them why she loves plants so much. 

We’re sure that Utuska and Jigyasa’s conversations would have made you ask questions. You can leave them on our website [https://www.indiaaskswhy.org/contact/](https://www.indiaaskswhy.org/contact/), and we’ll pick them up :)
