Utsuka and Jigyasa spotted a snake charmer on the streets. Utsuka was mesmerized by its dance. But they both realized that the dancing snake had no legs or arms. That made them wonder: “Why snakes don’t have limbs?”

They learn about the story of the past snakes and how they might have lost limbs. They also discuss how present-day scientists study snake evolution.

In the interview segment, they talk with Dr. Megha Kumar, a scientist from CCMB who studies early forms of animals – embryos. Dr. Kumar talks about how researchers study snakes and other animals to answer questions about how their bodies develop. Dr. Kumar also shares her journey to becoming a scientist.
