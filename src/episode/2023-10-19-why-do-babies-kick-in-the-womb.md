“Why do babies kick in the womb?” ShreeKilambi and Karthik, from Delhi Public School Secunderabad, ask. Once when Utsuka and Jigyasa were chatting with their curious friends, they happened upon the topic of babies! That’s when one of them wondered why babies kick when they are still in their mother's womb. 

In the second episode of season 03 of IndiaAsksWhy, we learn about the development of bones in the unborn baby. We take a deep dive into how the bone-to-brain connection is tested out in the developing baby. The curious group also spoke to the developmental biologist,[Prof. Amitabha Bandyopadhyay](https://iitk.ac.in/new/amitabha-bandyopadhyay), from IIT Kanpur, to understand how one could possibly study developing bones in a lab!

We’re sure this conversation between the curious group would have made you curious, too. You can send your follow-up questions on our [website](https://www.indiaaskswhy.org/contact/), and we’ll pick them up :)
