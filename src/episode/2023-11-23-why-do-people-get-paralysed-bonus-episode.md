“Why do people get paralyzed?” Kanishka and Myra from Delhi Public School, Secunderabad, ask. Check out our [previous episode](https://www.indiaaskswhy.org/episode/2023-11-19-why-do-people-get-paralysed/) where the curious explorers along with Utsuka and Jigyasa explore this question. 


Both our curious explorers had so many more questions about brain diseases after they understood that paralysis can be a result of certain kinds of brain diseases. So, we have a bonus episode! Listen to find out what they learned.
