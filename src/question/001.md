Did you know that just like you many neuroscientists and evolutionary biologists puzzled over this question? Over the years, they came up with many theories to explain this fascinating working of the brain and body. They found that a long, long time ago, something remarkable happened with one of our ancestors! During the early stages of growth of our ancestors as an ‘embryo’ i.e., while they were just beginning growing in their mom’s tummy, there was a real ‘twist’ within. Their body took a 90-degree turn within the embryo, while their brain did not flip with it. Can you imagine what this meant? The part of the brain which we called the forebrain was now in a reverse position then the rest of the nervous system in the body. This switch meant that now the right brain sent messages and controlled the left side of the body and vice-versa. And this continues to be the case with all of us even to this day!
