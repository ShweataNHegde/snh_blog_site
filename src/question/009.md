Nowadays, markets are flooded with dietary supplements ranging from protein powders to multivitamin capsules and even fiber! Many athletes, body-builders and even teenagers nowadays consume protein powders along with their everyday diets. But do they really need this extra protein? 

It is well known that proteins are the building blocks of a human body. Our body needs approximately 0.8 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. It's the minimum amount we need to keep from getting sick — not the specific amount we are supposed to eat every day. This requirement can be sufficiently met by our everyday diet. 

The powdered forms of protein come from plants (soybeans, peas, rice, potatoes), eggs, or milk (casein or whey protein).

Excess and unmonitored, prolonged consumption of protein powders can risk health. There are limited studies that claim the ill-effects of excess protein consumption on the liver. Few cases have been reported where patients with Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) were found to be consuming relatively higher amounts of protein in their everyday diet. This data suggests that there could be a possible negative influence of excess protein intake on the liver but nothing has been proven directly so far.  However, regular consumption of these “protein packages” is found to trigger health diseases, diabetes, cancer, and even premature death in certain cases.

Therefore it is important for us to be mindful of what and how much we are eating. Avoid eating protein (and other dietary supplements) unless prescribed by a doctor.
